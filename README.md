Advent of Code 2025 solutions in TypeScript.

## Setup

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Running Solutions

Run solutions using `tsx`:
```bash
tsx day1/part1.ts
tsx day1/part2.ts
```

Or use npm scripts (add them to package.json as you create new days):
```bash
npm run day1:part1
npm run day1:part2
```

## Project Structure

Each day will have its own folder (e.g., `day1/`) containing:
- `part1.ts` - Solution for part 1
- `part2.ts` - Solution for part 2
- `example.txt` - Example input from the puzzle
- `input.txt` - Your actual puzzle input
